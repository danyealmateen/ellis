# Simple Social Media Page using Firebase
This is a basic social media page that allows users to sign in, create a new user, write status updates, visit other people's profiles, and delete their own account. The project uses Firebase to store user information, including their usernames, passwords, and status updates.

## Requirements
### The website
* Sign in: users can log in with a username and associated password, which is checked against the firebase database. Note that this is not secure.
* Create User: users can create a new account, which includes a username, password, and a profile picture chosen from three default images.
* Logged in User: once logged in, the user can see their own status updates, add new status updates, visit other users' pages, and delete their own account.
* Visiting Users: there is a list of all users, and each user's profile is clickable to visit their page. Each user's page displays their username, profile picture, and their latest status updates.
### Technologies
* TypeScript: the entire project is written in TypeScript.
* Firebase: used to store user information and status updates.
* Parcel: a simple bundler used to bundle the code.
